<h1>Task attribute order convention</h1>

In order to make the Ansible tasks in Vlad easy to read they should follow the following order of attributes:

1. `name` - should also follow the [name convention](naming_convention.md).
2. `module` - followed by attributes (e.g. `command: ls -la`).
3. `with_items` - used to supply a list of options to the task.
4. `sudo` - used if the task needs sudo access.
5. `when` - used to run a check before running the task.
6. `tags` - roles will generally have their own tags so these should only be added to tasks in certain circumstances.
7. Any other option pertinent to the operation of the task (e.g. `changed_when`, `failed_when` etc).
8. `notify` - needed if the task changes something that needs to restart a service. This should always appear at the end of the task block.

## Examples

```
#!yaml

- name: add varnish vcl
  template: src=varnish_defaultvcl.j2 dest=/etc/varnish/default.vcl
  sudo: true
  notify:
   - restart varnish
```

```
#!yaml

- name: install MailCatcher prerequisite packages
  apt: pkg={{ item }} state=installed
  with_items:
    - rubygems
    - libsqlite3-dev
    - ruby-dev
  sudo: true
```
