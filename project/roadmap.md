<h1>Road Map</h1>

Future development prospects.

## Version 1.0

A full release of the system is rapidly approaching. We are working to make Vlad more stable and more configurable.

- Add multi operating system support - Done
- Add documentation and mkdocs support - In progress
- All open bugs should be addressed - In progress
- Add dependencies to roles so that when installing elements they require prerequisites to be installed also - In progress
- Test with (and possibly add support for) different virtual machine systems - VMware Fusion now supported

## Version 1.1

- Add multiple site support within a single box so that a single Vlad build can have multiple sites installed.

## Beyond Version 1.1

- Add Nginx support
- Provide better Solr support with options for multiple collections
