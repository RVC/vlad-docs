<h1>Ansible Galaxy roles</h1>

Most of Vlad's current functionality resides within Vlad's own codebase. The rest comes from roles available on Ansible Galaxy that are not exclusive to Vlad itself. As such, documentation of these roles, in particular what default variables they provide, is located within the README.md file of each respective role (there's an [ongoing conversation](https://github.com/hashbangcode/vlad-docs/issues/16) about how to improve on this).
